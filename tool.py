    # 11: see if t already concretized
    # 12: if t not yet concretized, concretize it ourselves. (is this actually a valid step? I think waiting for it to concretize is the only method we have to know that the relation applies to all t! (possibly this may only apply to some scenario's)) (one reason t might not concretize though is that k, pubs, or secrets, could be negative, and this makes the comparison still undeterministic at this point. Thus, it may be good to make sure only positive k's or p's are considered at this point.
    # 13: generate a public value to create this behavior.

    #of course we might as well just try different relations between s, s', and k directly without forming k ourselves... but that brings us a lot less close to a solution if we don't know what exactly the relation is in the actual program. current approach should give us more fine-grained control. A problem with a guessing approach is also that if you don't know that there is a s>=k relationship, you don't know whether s==k+1 and s'==k are actually edge cases

    #time cannot yet become concrete because a negative or zero public value messes with large secrets. (same for secrets... should probably be sure to check results when taking out edge cases such as negative values and zeroes.

    #TODO PARKED: how do we deal with multiple relations on s? should we treat them individually or holistically?
    #let's not worry about this right now
    #currently I'm extracting the relations sRk but only using the relation from that, throwing overboard the rest of the expression.
    #two import things should be noted here:
    #   we lose the constraints on k.
    #   we lose the actual "minimal" expression on s that we were able to form, which may not always be s itself.
    #       thus, we may want to replace k in sRk with split, and add a constraint that k == split.

    #NOTE: even if time doesn't become concrete it still shows that time depends on the secret (up to the limitations of the constraint solver of course)
    #this gives a good basis for further manual analysis
